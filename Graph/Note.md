## Introduction

Graphs are useful in modeling and solving real-world problems. For example, the problem to find the least number of flights between two cities can be modeled using a graph, where the vertices represent cities and the edges represent the flights between two adjacent cities. The problem of finding the minimal number of connecting flights between two cities is reduced to finding a shortesst path between two vertices in a graph.  

The study of graph problems is known as the /*graph theory*/. Graph theory was founded by Leonhard Eurler in 1736, when he introduced graph terminology to solve the famous /*Seven Bridges of Konigsberg*/ problem. The city of Konisberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was divided by the Pregel River. There were two islands on the river.
